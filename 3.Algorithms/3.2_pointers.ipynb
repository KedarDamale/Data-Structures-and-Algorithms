    "### üîç **What is the Two Pointer Approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **two-pointer approach** is a powerful **technique used in arrays or lists** when you're trying to process elements from **both ends of the data structure simultaneously**. It‚Äôs often used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Searching pairs\n",
    "* Reversing arrays\n",
    "* Sorting variants (like this one!)\n",
    "* Solving in **linear time (O(n))**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° **Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You maintain **two indices (pointers)** that move **towards each other** or in **the same direction** based on conditions in your problem.\n",

    "### üß† **How it Works (Step-by-Step):**\n",
    "\n",

    "We want to return the **squares of a sorted array**, but also keep the **result sorted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "The array might contain **negative numbers**, and **squaring them** can create **larger values** than positive numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: `[-6, -1, 2] ‚Üí squares = [36, 1, 4]` ‚Üí needs sorting after squaring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **two pointers** to pick the **largest square values** from both ends and move inward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "arr = [-6, -1, 2]\n",
    "         ^     ^\n",
    "         L     R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare `abs(arr[L])` and `abs(arr[R])`\n",
    "* Whichever is larger, square it, and put it in the result\n",
    "* Then move that pointer inward (`L += 1` or `R -= 1`)\n",
    "* Continue until `L > R`\n",
    "* Finally, reverse the result because we pushed biggest squares first\n",
